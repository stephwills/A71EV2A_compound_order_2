# A71EV2A_compound_order_2

Compound submission using pipeline enumerating from all new A71EV2A fragments. Imposed some cut-offs to reduce compounds for selection to near 100 (num non-hyd ints > 2, sucos > 0.55, comrmsd > 1,5), butina clustering for diversity selection > 219 compounds. Manual selection to reduce 219 to 110 and removed 2 from previous iteration to give final list of 108.
